# DestinE Jupyter Notebook Tutorials for the Insula's Code Lab

This set of Jupyter Notebook tutorials equips users with the skills to access and exploit Digital Twin data from DestinE for the Insula Code Lab.

* [How to work with Climate Adaptation with High-Resolution Data on DestinE Platform: Integrating Single-Level Fields and Surface Insights](./climate-dt-sfc.ipynb)
* [How to access LUMI's Extremes Digital Twin data using earthkit and the Polytope API](./polytope-earthkit.ipynb)

If you have questions or need support with these examples, contact the support at https://platform.destine.eu/support.

## Credits

* `climates-dt-sfc.ipynb` is largely inspired by the inputs provided by the [Earth Data Hub use cases](https://earthdatahub.com/use-cases).
* `polytope-earthkit.ipynb` is a slightly modified version of the example available at [Destination Earth Digital Twins's polytope examples](https://github.com/destination-earth-digital-twins/polytope-examples/).
* `desp-authentication.py` was also retrieved from the [Destination Earth Digital Twins's polytope examples](https://github.com/destination-earth-digital-twins/polytope-examples/).
