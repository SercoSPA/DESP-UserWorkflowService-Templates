# DestinE Jupyter Notebook Tutorials for the Insula's Code Lab

This set of Jupyter Notebook tutorials equips users with the skills to access and exploit Digital Twin data from DestinE for the Insula Code Lab. Examples are all written in Python. <br>
Tutorials are seamlessly integrated into the Insula Code Lab Python environment for all users. 

* [DestinE Platform CacheB data access](./cacheb/cacheb-climate-example.ipynb): this example supports the user in accessing the DESP Data CacheB Service and work with Climate Adaptation DT data.
* [How to access LUMI's Extremes Digital Twin data using earthkit and the Polytope API](./polytope/polytope-earthkit.ipynb): this example supports the user to retrieve Weather Extremes DT data from Polytope and visualize it.
* [How to discover and access data from DestinE Platform](./EDEN/EDEN-example.ipynb): this example supports the user in discover and access DestinE data through EDEN Service.
* [DestinE Data Streaming](./DestineStreamer/era5.ipynb): this example supports the user in the discovery of DestinE data streams through the DestinE Streamer Service.

## Installation
The CodeLab environment includes some Python packages pre-installed in the user's environment. The overall list of dependencies is provided in the file [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).
> **Note**: Pre-installed Python packages listed in this file provide a snapshot of dependencies needed to run the example notebooks provided in this repository.

To install new packages persistently in the coding environment, users can create their own virtual environment in Insula Code Lab by following the guidelines below.

## How to create a virtual environment
Open a Terminal window and create a virtual environment named `my_env`: 
```
python -m venv /home/jovyan/my_env
```
Activate it:
```
source /home/jovyan/my_env/bin/activate
```
### Install dependencies
Install Python dependencies in the virtual environment as follows.<br>
* Open a terminal window and install a single module singularly:
```
pip install <package>
```
Or install modules in batch by means of a requirements file:
* Open a terminal window and type:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Install the kernel
Install the Jupyter kernel `my_env`:
```
ipython kernel install --user --name=my_env
```
> **Note**: Do not forget to change the kernel to `my_env` using the upper-right button within the Jupyter user interface every time you want to run your code.
> Occasionally, a stop/start of the service is required to apply environment changes. Users can manage the server stop/start commands via the *File* dropdown menu under *Hub Control Panel*.
