    "# Service Registry – DestinE Platform Data Offer \n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides an overview of the datasets currently published in the DestinE Platform Service Registry.\n",
    "For each dataset, you will find a short description, the corresponding reference (when available), and its associated data hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended for Service Providers involved in the creation of their Service Data Offer as part of the Onboarding Integration process.\n",
    "We recommend running it to stay up to date with the full DestinE Platform data offering and to support the design of your own service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data hierarchy in the Service Registry is organized as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Program/\n",
    "└── Program_Subset/\n",
    "    └── Collection/\n",
    "        └── Dataset\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code retrieves the parent–child relationships starting from the `Dataset` level and walking backward through the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We kindly invite Service Providers willing to onboard a new service to use the current DestinE Platform data offer as their baseline for the Service Registry/Data Portfolio Survey."
